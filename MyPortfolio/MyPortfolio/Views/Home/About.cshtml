                <p>As an intern at TECHPLEMENT, I develop robust and secure cross-platform software, using C# and .NET Core technologies. I have contributed to several projects, such as creating an ASP.NET API for a customer relationship management system and building a .NET MVC web application for a health care provider. I have also learned how to use Microsoft Azure to deploy and manage cloud-based solutions.</p>
                <p>I am a third-year student of Computer Science Engineering at Aditya Engineering College, where I have acquired a solid foundation in programming, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles. I am passionate about learning new skills and technologies, and I am eager to apply them to real-world problems. My goal is to become a full-stack developer who can create innovative and scalable software products.</p>
